# OpenAI_Discord_Bot

This is just a simple discord bot powered by OpenAI (https://openai.com/), for the moment it can chat a bit and answer some questions.
I'm planning to improve it in the future, following the improvements of OpenAI.

Commands : 

!hello : Just say hello lol

!log (admin only) : See the logs (log_user.txt)

!count_request (admin only) : Count the number of request

!shutdown (admin only) : Stop the bot


/!\ Remember, to use this bot, you need an access to OpenAI API (More infos here : https://openai.com/api/) /!\
/!\ Moreover, be careful when sending messages to this bot, the API can cost money and every message sent is a request to the API /!\
